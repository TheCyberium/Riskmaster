This is a free tool to help organisations and companies with their NIST assessments. Questions are based on NIST Special Publication 800-53A. It helps to go through the process of analysing total risk posture. It's a very simple but powerful tool and concept. 

There are two types of roles: Admin or Expert. Admin creates users and experts answer questions. Averages answers to ratings 1-5 is rendered in a star shaped risk profile.

I've been hacking away at this but feel free to use it and develop it.
